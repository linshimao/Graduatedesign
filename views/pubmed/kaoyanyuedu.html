    <div class="some-little-word">President Clinton‘s decision on Apr.8 to send Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji packing without an agreement on China‘s entry into the World Trade Organization seemed to be a massive miscalculation. The President took a drubbing from much of the press, <span class="into-some-word">which had breathlessly reported that a deal was in the bag.</span></div>
    <span class="most-word"><p>The Cabinet and Whit House still appeared divided, and business leaders were characterized as furious over the lost opportunity. Zhu charged that Clinton lacked ―the courage‖ to reach an accord. And when Clinton later telephoned the angry Zhu to pledge a renewed effort at negotiations, the gesture was widely portrayed as a flip-flop.  In fact, Clinton made the right decision in holding out for a better WTO deal. A lot more horse trading is needed before a final agreement can be reached. And without the Administration‘s goal of a ―bullet-proof agreement‖ that business lobbyists can enthusiastically sell to a Republican Congress, the whole process will end up in partisan acrimony that could harm relations with China for years.  THE HARD PART. Many business lobbyists, while disappointed that the deal was not closed, agree that better terms.can still be had. And Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, National into the WTO. And Senators Jesse A. Helms (R-N.C.) and Emest F. Hollings (D-S. C.) promised to introduce a bill requiring congressional approval of any deal.  The hidden message from these three textile-state Southerners: Get more protection for the U. S. clothing industry. Hoping to smooth the way, the Administration tried, but failed, to budge Zhu on textiles. Also left in the lurch: Wall Street, Hollywood, and Detroit. Zhu refused to open up much of the lucrative Chinese securities market and insisted on ―cultural‖ restrictions on American movies and music. He also blocked efforts to allow U. S. auto makers to provide fleet financing.  BIG JOB. Already, business lobbyists are blanketing Capitol Hill to presale any eventual agreement, but what they‘ve heard so far isn‘t encouraging. Republicans, including Lott, say that ―the time just isn‘t right‖ for the deal. Translation: We‘re determined to make it look as if Clinton has capitulated to the Chinese and is ignoring human, religious, and labor rights violations; the theft of nuclear-weapons technology; and the sale of missile parts to America‘s enemies.
